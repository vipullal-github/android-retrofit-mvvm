# android-retrofit-mvvm
Android Client-server example using Retrofit, MVVM and a simple Node.js server

This is ment to be a complete example of how to use Retrofit in an Android app. 
The codebase includes a simple Restful endpoint using Node.js. 

## Seting up the project on your PC.
1.  Download or clone the code into your PC
1.  cd to the Server directory and hit _npm install_. This will pull in all the modules required 
    for the server
1.  From the command line, hit _npm start_. You should see this on the console:
>   >   nodemon server.js
>
>   [nodemon] 2.0.4
>   [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
>   [nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
>   [nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
>   [nodemon] starting `node server.js index.js`
>   RESTful API server started on: 3000

Next, open the project from the Android folder and build and run.
